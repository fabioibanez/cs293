We had Student I and C, you were going to show us what you said for the second problem.
[teacher] So everybody, when I say represent or show it, it’s important to draw it in pictures as well, because I noticed a couple of people were having difficulty understanding what to do, why would they have difficulty?  Why would some people maybe divide, why do you think you had a little problem with that, Student M, why do you think you did that instead of, where did you make your mistake?",I did division because I didn’t underline [Inaudible],"[teacher] Right, so underlining is helping, Student R, you to understand the question.  Okay, Student L.  Underlining is helping you to understand it and go back and simplify and think about you really need to do.  All right?  So it’s really important that you underline the important part.  And like Student J said, it’s not four oranges, it’s four oranges in each bag.  That’s really important because when you go to draw it, it’s gonna be important, all right, so then once you start drawing it out, you know right away when you see repeated, what is she doing here? She’s got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 bags, right, oh, I’m sorry.  I think we are supposed to be using the black markers only up here, but that’s all right.  So we’ve got 6 times what?

[teacher] That Student N, is really stuck and that he doesn’t understand and then it takes a really nice person like Student M, to be like hey, Student N, do you need help catching up or understanding this, but what you really don’t want is to be ending this challenge, oh Student G, I have a piece of paper for you and your group can tell you what to do.  You really don’t want to be ending this challenge with like three people in your group having all the answers and one person having no clue.  Okay?  So let’s just quickly go over the rules here. Rules, half-inch grid is for recording.  Everyone in your group must have it.  Now, let’s say Student C is just like, I’m not doing anything.  I’m having a bad day, my team didn’t win. I refuse to do it.   Obviously, you can’t change that and I’ll make exceptions if someone in your group is just being straight up impossible and I know that happens. That happened in the last class.  Okay, hold up the paper that’s for recording.  Wave it around kind of quietly.  Okay. One-inch grid is for experimenting, cutting, taping, you don’t have to make the cubes.  I’m not grading the actual cubes you create.  If you just fold it and see that it makes a cube don’t bother with the tape. The tape is for scissor and if you need to do surgery.  By that I mean, if you make a net that’s just a little off and you need to change something, do some surgery with the tape and the scissors, I’ll give you hints about that later. And lastly, flips, rotations do not count.  Let’s say, I keep losing my marker.  Let’s say you decided that net would make a cube, which it doesn’t.  So Student M is like ooh, ooh, guys, guys, I got another one.  And Student M draws this. Okay, Student M, what’s wrong with this one?  Oh, G, do you have an answer?
[student] Reflection.
[teacher] It’s a reflection, wonderful, so it won’t count.  Are there any last questions about this group challenge?   Yes.","So if you and your group like if pretend Student M had three-, counts wrong and he thinks he has 11, but he only has 10, what would happen then?","[teacher] That I’m understanding about.  What I’m concerned about is if who can I pick on now, if Student J is going, guys, I only have three can you help me and they are like, no Student J, we’re trying to finish this, shhhh be quiet.  And Student J is like, but guys, I want to get the next one and I want our group to win and they are like Student J, just follow along, I’m looking for that kind of stuff, okay? So I think I gave the last class half an hour for this.
[student] Oh my god.
[teacher] We’ll see though.  One last word of caution, what happens if you are like, oh, oh, oh, guys make the Student L, the Student L’s gonna make a net, oh, oh!  What’s going to happen?  Student M?

[teacher] Alright come over here so I can see what you do. 400, first let me finish doing what you hadn’t even started doing. You saw everybody write a name so you don’t even have to ask me what we had to do cause you did know that part. Finish writing the states down at the bottom like everybody in here has already done.

So is that your angle card? And then let’s say you have a side card – do you mind if I borrow this as an example – and then the side card says ‘Only one pair of sides is parallel.’  So the idea is you have to find a shape that meets both of these requirements.
[student] Right.  And so –
[teacher] It can have no right angles and it can only have one pair of sides that are parallel.

[teacher] Yeah, I won't have enough groups, right?  But I'm trying to find groups.  So this means groups, friends.  Okay?  When you're drawing this out, you need to know that this means groups when you're drawing your circles.  The number inside stands for how many are in each group, and we’re not trying to find how many each group 'cause we know the answer to that.  How many are in each group, Student N?
[student] Four.
[teacher] Four.  We know that already, okay.  So the number that goes inside of that circle means the number in each group.  The circle means group.  Okay, so today we're trying to find groups.  So you want to keep circling until you – so what did you guys – so some of you are done.  So who can kind of take me through the process so I can move on and show you how to do remainders?  Can somebody raise their hand?  I'm gonna erase this if that's okay?  Okay?  It's up there on an anchor chart over there.  I need more room. So I'm going to write TIPS.  As I came around I felt like a lot of you were drawing out.  That was good.  You definitely want to draw something.  Because if you haven’t already – I came by and I just checked on a few of you right now so that was good.  So let's work on just drawing out.  What do I draw? Who wants to come up?  Let's have you guys teach.  Okay, Student J, come on up and draw whatever.  You can bring your book up if you want.  If you don't feel like you need it – and I’ll help you hold it.  That's fine.  Here you go. I can help you hold it.  Draw whatever you drew.  You can draw.",So I first I tried to do a few times to get me to 72.  First I tried 15 times 4 because you're using the 4 because you put 4 cookies in each bag so that equals 60.  So I know it's –,"[teacher] Do you just want to talk to the group though just so that they can hear?
[student] So I know that’s not right because I have to get to 72.  So then I took 17 times 4 and that gave me 68.  So then I moved up just one to 18 times 4 and then that 8 times 4 is 32 and that's 7 so that gave me 72.  So it's 18.
[teacher] Okay, so Student J figured out that the answer is 18.  So that's the way that he did it.  Okay.  Now he's using what's called algorithms which are quick and short, but what did I – what I'm trying to teach you is how to figure it out using pictures.  Okay? So who can come up – and that's fine, Student J, and you want to use that way and that's what works for you as a mathematician that helps you to be fast and quick, that's fine.  But today I really want to focus on drawing pictures.  Who can come up to the board and draw a picture of the problem because that to me is really important.  Student T, you want to try?  Sorry.  I said Student T, but come on Student T, that's fine.  I’ll get you next time Student T, okay?  I can hold it for you if you need help.

[teacher] Don't bother about the spelling.  Don't bother about the spelling.  Good job.  Good.  So it's ninety-nine and what?
[multiple students] Eighty-eight thousandths.
[teacher] Eighty-eight thousandths.  Ninety-nine and eighty-eight thousandths.  Everybody sees that.  Okay.  Now look at question fourteen, and Student E, that is for you.  I'm not going to do all of the questions.  I'm just doing some. The others, you will have to do on your own.  Question fourteen, Student L.  Read the question for me.","The weight of an insect is less than one gram.  The weight has a zero in the tenths place, a one in the hundredths place, and a two in the thousandths place.

"[multiple students] Yes.
[teacher] Some of you might be done.  If you are finished, then you can just look over it to make sure that you are happy with the way that it is.  And if you are not done, now is your time to get it done.  I'm gonna set about ten minutes on my timer.  And if we need less time than that, then we will take less time.  But I'm gonna give you at least ten minutes to finish it up.  And then we're gonna start something new.  So my timer is set for ten minutes.  You get ten minutes to finish it up.
[student] Can we find new ways to check it or [inaudible]?
[teacher] Well, the best way to check it is going to be to draw the picture and do the math part of it.  So let's look at what you have.  A lawn mower holds three fourths a gallon of gas.  So I'd be drawing that picture.  I could be drawing a whole gallon cut into fourths with three of it filled.",Can you [find] the gallon?,"[student] I don't know how to.
[teacher] I guess draw it – basically remember yesterday when I showed you the cups, like a cup of cheese.  You're just drawing a container and cut into fourths because you need to have three-fourths of it filled.  So that's the whole amount.
[student] I can make it like that.  That's the way it fills up the gas.
[teacher] That works.  So now show three fourths of that.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,
