[student] One hundred and twenty-five hundredths is less than thirty-five tenths.
[teacher] Say this again.",One hundred and twenty-five thousandths is less than thirty- five—,"[teacher] Hundredths.  Okay.  One hundred twenty-five thousandths, which is one eighth, is less than thirty-five hundredths.  Now when you look at this, you see 125, and you see 35, and automatically your mind things, well, I know 125 is greater than 35.  But it's not 125.  It's one hundred twenty-five thousandths is less than thirty-five thousandths, because remember, you have to start comparing the tenths place. The 1 is less than 3.  Now how did we get to this point? One eighth, guys, and seven twentieths – we cannot use common denominators here, can we?  But remember, I said you can use division.  1 divided by 8.  7 divided by 20.  Then of course you would have to use decimals.  Questions? Student S's team gets the point, and it looks like this team over here, Student E's team, you have more points, so I need you all to get ready to transition, and everybody on this team, come back and I'll get you a piece of candy. Let me dump this over here on the table.  You can choose one piece.
[teacher] Okay boys and girls, I’m gonna be using the overhead today.  I So I want you to look right now at the objectives up on the board for math.  Would someone please read the first objective right here with the bullet beside it?  Would someone read it for me please?  Student C?

"[student] We didn't need [inaudible] minutes.
[teacher] Okay.  Let me hear from Student, sitting way back there in the back.  Student?
[student] Negative one.
[teacher] She says negative one is the answer.  Now, what mistake did Tanya make?  Because those are the answers I wanted.  We're analyzing this to see where this student went wrong and what the answer should be.  You found out what the answer should be.  There's another question.  How did you discover the answer?  So where'd she go wrong?  Where did she go wrong, Student?","She thought she could just add because the negative is higher. She thought she could just add the positive with the negative and equal another negative but – yeah, equal another positive but she couldn't, but she had to – how could I say it?","[teacher] Okay, you're off to a good start.  I'm gonna come back to you. Where'd she go wrong, Student?
[student] She went wrong because I think she didn't notice that the seven wasn't a negative, so she just added negative eight plus negative seven to get negative 15, but the seven is actually positive, so it should have been negative one.
[teacher] Okay, how many people agree with Student's explanation of where Tanya went wrong?
[student] [Inaudible]",0,1,0
"[student] Yeah.
[teacher] Okay.  Now, let’s go back.  We’ve got a group of square numbers, what other way could we classify the numbers, Student A?

[teacher] Wait a second.
[student] But I’m not sure I can, like, subtract.
[teacher] [Inaudible] put a dozen on each plate, to sell for $2.00 a plate.  How many full plates?  Okay, so first you have to add, right?  So you added the two numbers, okay?  Then you divide them by 12, which is correct.  So you’re right.  Now you’re doing 12 into 105.","So it goes in eight times, right?","[student] Oh, yeah.

[teacher] You’re having problems.  What’s giving you problem?
[student] That.",0,1,0
"[teacher] I’m sorry?
[student] [Inaudible].
[teacher] [Inaudible] geometry vocabulary.  It’s the same thing you did when you wrote your geometry vocabulary, when you wrote point.  So the word we’re going to do today is called line. If you already wrote that down it’s good.  Just line, L-I- N-E.  It’s a straight angle that never ends.  Did you know that a line is an angle?
[teacher] It’s 180 degrees.  A straight angle that never ends is called a line.  The way we draw it is like this.  This is the way we draw it.  Have you got this?  You with me?  The symbol for it looks like this.  Actually [inaudible].  The way we write it is to draw that symbol on top and then you use the letters A and B or whatever letters you have on your point, whatever points you’re using. The way we say it is line A-B.  We’re going to do some more practice on this tomorrow, but I want you to get it down.  I’m going to tell you one more thing.  You have to have a point on a line and then I’m going to tell you something else.  Raise your hand if you’re [Inaudible].  Please write nice and neat so when you get home to do your homework you know how to do it. [Inaudible].  Everybody finished?  Can I erase it?  The next thing I’m going to tell you about is called a parallel line. Parallel line.  You can read your notebook. Parallel lines are two lines – to or more lines that will never meet. They never cross, they never intersect, they never come together.  I see this line of people and this line of people and they’re parallel.  If we turn this way and you three all turn that way and we just start walking [inaudible] and keep going, you will never, ever run into each other, right? If Student S starts walking this way and Student E starts walking that way, they’re eventually gonna crash, right because they’re not sitting parallel from one another.  See the difference?  That’s the definition.  The way we draw it is like this.  It can be that way, it can be horizontally or it can be parallel.  It can be horizontal or vertical.",Do we have to draw the arrows on it?,"[teacher] Yes. The symbol is this.  When we write it – this is so cute, I love doing this.  This is A-B and it’s parallel to C-D. The way we say it is line A-B is parallel to line C-D.  So what I want you to take away from the lesson today is point, parallel line and what else?  Line.  Everybody freeze.  So today I want you to know by tomorrow when you come in, your homework, make sure you read over those three things we learned about today.  Who can tell me what a point is?
[student] An exact location on a –it’s an exact location.
[teacher] An exact location on a line.  Go ahead, Student R?

[student] Of what?
[teacher] Of any polygon.  What is the parameter of a polygon?
[student] You add all the sides.",0,0,0
"[student] Are we allowed to get help?
[teacher] You will get the points back because I threw a lot of stuff at you quickly to see who has it and who has grasped the concept.  Like I said, you can do one problem.  You should be able to do any problem I give you, right?  Some of you have done very, very well and you were able to keep up with the pace and get it.  Some of you have totally lost you. There’s three or four of you in here I have lost. You need to fix it and bring it back.  The only day I am accepting it is on the 11th.  If you don’t have it on the 11th—you, the 12th because you won’t be here the 11th.  I already know that.  If you're not here the 11th, you need to bring it to me the day you return.  If you don’t have it that day, the grade on it is the grade that stands in your grade book. It is your choice.
[student] So there was no hundreds, right?
[teacher] And then you have the two bonus questions that could put you up over 100.  So those of mine that got 100 can go back and fix and make sure you have the two bonus.  Fix the two you got wrong, then you can have more than 100.  It is your choice.  So in your agenda write down “Fix math quiz on fractions, decimals, and algebra is due on the 11th.” You can go on IXL and do some practice on the problems you missed. You can take your big math book home and use it as a resource to help you.  You can take your math journal home because in your math journal you have a sample of every type of problem that was on that quiz.  You can use your parents or an older brother or sister to help you.  To ask for help. And what I told a couple of students, because I had a couple come see me this morning, was if you missed it, I have walked you through it now, write yourself another problem or ask someone to write you another problem to see if you really understand it and you get it.  You're gonna be off a week. We only have two weeks and then you take the CRCT, okay? So we gotta make sure we’re ready.  Okay?  Those will be in your Friday folder today going home.  I'm gonna give them to your teachers once you go to specials.  Student W?","Did you ever, like, grade them, like—do you ever grade us like 95 and then you get, like, all 100 and then you get all the bonus, would it make it like 104 or something.  Can you go higher than like just to 100?","[student] What was the majority of the grades?
[teacher] There was a lot of everything.  The class was pretty well divided.
[student] Who got 100?
[teacher] You and Student A.  Any questions?  Do you understand that?  So if you want it back, it’s your responsibility where you have nine days at home.  If you don’t care, I don’t care. It’s your choice.  Some of you made careless mistakes.  And some of you didn’t get finished but only three or four people didn’t get finished.  The majority of you got finished.  So that’s the thing.  If you paid attention in class, you’ve been doing the practice, you had enough time to have it done.  You either knew it or you didn’t.  Right? You can’t sit there and look at it.  It’s not gonna give you the answer. All right, you are going to work in the group that you are sitting with.  Get your desks completely cleaned off.  You can use—you're gonna need—you're gonna get two sheets of paper so that should be enough paper for you to work with.  You need your desk for your space.  So stack your math materials on your floor.  I got four, five.  Student W, turn around and work with those three.  Student J, do you want to go back there?",0,0,1
"[student] Five-sixths.
[teacher] What do you think?
[student] That that’s wrong.
[teacher] Okay.","Because you only [inaudible] this can, but five and six [inaudible] you only need one more to make six, and six …","[teacher] Okay, so which one [inaudible] is bigger?
[student] I think that I agree.
[teacher] Which one do you think is the largest?  [Inaudible].
[student] B.",1,1,0
"[student] Can we have one of your pens later if we don’t have one.
[teacher] If you don’t have your own.  But if you have your own, use yours first.  Do not flip these tests over yet.  Do not flip that over, Student G, do not even think about it.
[student] How many minutes do we have?
[teacher] Well, here’s what I did with the last class.  Ssssh.  I’ve been asked the question how many minutes do we get for this one. Yesterday I thought, wow, almost everybody finished in seven minutes, that was so great, maybe I’ll do six today. And then I saw that the last class needed – a lot of them were still working after six, so I gave them 7 minutes, 15 seconds, which was exactly what I gave them yesterday.  And a lot of kids did really well and some kids didn’t do quite as well because they don’t know their higher facts.  So I will give you 7 minutes, 15 seconds just like yesterday, and if you don’t do as well just know that you have some facts that you need to keep studying. When we’re finished we will switch with a partner or three-way just so that nobody has their own paper and I’ll pass out pens for those who need them.  So for the people who weren’t here yesterday, and there’s a lot of you, basically this is out of 100 points and however many you get right is what your score is.  So if you get 90 out of 100, that’s a 90 percent, because remember percent is always out of 100.  So my advice is if you get stuck on something, don’t sit there counting in your head, move on, because you want to come back to the hardest ones at the end.  Do as many as you possibly can first to get your score high and then go back afterwards to the ones that were harder at the very end. The people who weren’t here yesterday I might just time you for 7 minutes or so today for yesterday’s test because I want to get that one too.  If not, we’ll get it done next week. What’s your question?","Excuse me, are these all two digits, one digits, or just one digit?","[teacher] They’re all facts.  So it’s going to go up through 12 times 12 but just facts.  You’re not actually doing work, they’re facts that you should know.  And you’re good at your facts, so don’t worry about it. Other questions?  Don’t write your name until the end.  If you finish before the 7 minutes 15 seconds is up, write your name.  Otherwise when I say stop you’ll write your name.  You should have a pencil in your hand, not a pen, because you’re taking the test with a pencil.  Okay, flip it over and you may begin.
[teacher] Stop if you’re still working.  Please put your name on it.  If you’re done your name should already be on it.  Please make sure it is, first and last, and now you may switch papers with your partner.  If your partner’s not here, please do another switch just so you don’t have your own.

[teacher] Yes we do, Student G.",0,0,1
"[student] If you build it, you will use the centimeter one [inaudible].
[teacher] You're gonna use the three quarter inch, the three quarter inch graph paper.  Student A?
[student] Number 4 is you plug in the actual answer.
[teacher] And then you're going to find the actual answer.  And once you have done that, you should say to yourself, hmmm, now that I know how to find the actual answer – eyes and ears up here.  How is that gonna help me with my prediction for number 2?  So this is very similar to or the same as what we were doing yesterday.  Student M?","If you do one of them first and then you know the actual answer when you do a check, you can use that check for the second one.  Like a prediction, you could use that.","[teacher] Absolutely.  Absolutely.  So on page 8 is where it may look slightly different.  So I'd like you to go to numbers 3, 4, and 5.

"[student] And don’t make your numerator bigger than the denominator.  It just makes it really difficult to me.
[teacher] Well you only do that if you get messed up on something, right? That would be a clue that you had messed up on something unless it was a problem where you needed to regroup and subtract mixed numbers.  All right.  You got it?  You can use 6 and you can use – it’s up to you, but just make sure you get the correct answer and you understand why you got that answer.  You understand, Student J?
[student] Number three has the same thing, but [inaudible].
[teacher] Student S, that’s a check.  You’re talking to somebody that’s not even in my math class, so I know it’s off task. All right.  We’re going to go to number three.

Take us through the steps.","Okay, seven twelfths minus one twelfth but you cannot subtract it yet because the denominator is not the same.  So you’ve got to find out how to make this denominator match that denominator. How do you get 2 from 12?","[teacher] Well let’s get a common denominator first.

[teacher] Yeah, I won't have enough groups, right?  But I'm trying to find groups.  So this means groups, friends.  Okay?  When you're drawing this out, you need to know that this means groups when you're drawing your circles.  The number inside stands for how many are in each group, and we’re not trying to find how many each group 'cause we know the answer to that.  How many are in each group, Student N?
[student] Four.
[teacher] Four.  We know that already, okay.  So the number that goes inside of that circle means the number in each group.  The circle means group.  Okay, so today we're trying to find groups.  So you want to keep circling until you – so what did you guys – so some of you are done.  So who can kind of take me through the process so I can move on and show you how to do remainders?  Can somebody raise their hand?  I'm gonna erase this if that's okay?  Okay?  It's up there on an anchor chart over there.  I need more room. So I'm going to write TIPS.

Let's have you guys teach.  Okay, Student J, come on up and draw whatever.  You can bring your book up if you want.  If you don't feel like you need it – and I’ll help you hold it.  That's fine.  Here you go. I can help you hold it.  Draw whatever you drew.  You can draw.",So I first I tried to do a few times to get me to 72.  First I tried 15 times 4 because you're using the 4 because you put 4 cookies in each bag so that equals 60.  So I know it's –,"[teacher] Do you just want to talk to the group though just so that they can hear?
[student] So I know that’s not right because I have to get to 72.  So then I took 17 times 4 and that gave me 68.  So then I moved up just one to 18 times 4 and then that 8 times 4 is 32 and that's 7 so that gave me 72.  So it's 18.
[teacher] Okay, so Student J figured out that the answer is 18.  So that's the way that he did it.  Okay.  Now he's using what's called algorithms which are quick and short, but what did I – what I'm trying to teach you is how to figure it out using pictures.  Okay? So who can come up – and that's fine, Student J, and you want to use that way and that's what works for you as a mathematician that helps you to be fast and quick, that's fine.  But today I really want to focus on drawing pictures.  Who can come up to the board and draw a picture of the problem because that to me is really important.  Student T, you want to try?  Sorry.  I said Student T, but come on Student T, that's fine.  I’ll get you next time Student T, okay?  I can hold it for you if you need help.

"[student] I don’t have a [inaudible] pen.
[teacher] Raise your hand if you need a pen, a blue pen.  You can’t use black; anything else is fine.  That’s not black.  All right, let’s talking about grading this for the people who were not here yesterday, here’s how we’re going to grade this.  Student E, listen up.  For the people who were not here yesterday, Student M, if we get it right, your partner gets it right, you don’t do anything, you leave it alone. If they get it wrong then you circle the answer.  If it’s wrong you circle it.  If they skip it you circle it, because it’s considered wrong either way. At the end we’re going to count up how many they missed and we’re going to circle it at the top.  We’re not gonna write a percent unless they get 100 percent.  But I say count it twice because I want to make sure we get the right number and that we’re accurate.  If you have a question you can put a little question mark next to it and you can ask them at the end.  But after you’ve done the question mark, I need to know if it’s right or wrong by putting a check if it’s right or you can put an X if it’s wrong after that. Those are the only for the ones you’re questioning.  If you know obviously it’s wrong, because their answer looks totally wrong, then you just circle it.  Are there questions?  Student C?
[student] I don’t have a pen.
[teacher] Okay, well, they’re right here, and I already asked people who needed pens?  Any other questions before I start grading? Your eyes should only be on the paper that you’re grading, not like this – looking over to see what your neighbor is doing with your paper.  Please do a good job because this is somebody else’s grade.  Student D?",I just had one question.  So you don’t write the…,"[teacher] You don’t have to worry about writing the right answer.
[student] But you don’t write the score unless it’s 100 percent?
[teacher] You don’t write the percent unless it’s 100 percent.  If they miss four you put minus four and you circle it.  You don’t worry about percent unless they got 100, because I’ll write the percent on there.  At the end you’ll get your paper back so you can see how you did, so don’t worry about looking over in the meantime.  So please be looking at your paper the entire time.  And again, for the people who weren’t here yesterday, you’re not writing in the right answer, you’re just circling it because I’m going to go fast and you might not have enough time to do that. Student G, do you know how to grade this paper?
[student] Yeah.",0,0,1
"[student] I think I – because I don't see two and –
[teacher] Let's see five.  It should be there because that's the right answer.  Did you already color it in on accident from something else, I wonder?  Yep, it's right there.
[student] Oh yeah.
[teacher] Make sure you don't have that as answer somewhere else.  Maybe you just went down because it was part of that?  Okay, is everybody else, you good?  You need help?  Okay.  Let me get the dice out.  When you finish, you'll need notebook paper to keep up with your – just do groups of two right now because there's plenty of people that are still working.  We don't need a group of three yet.  One 6-sided dice, two 10-sided dice and remember on your notebook paper you start with 49 and 99 hundredths.  That's what you're subtracting from.  Which one are you stuck on?",Stuck on that one and then I figured it out.,"[teacher] Did you figure it out?  Good.  Okay, I'm going to finish grading our speed test and I’ll be calling some of you over in just a few minutes.  Well everybody over to get your speed test, but give me just a minute.  How many rounds do you go in the decimal round up?
[multiple students] Ten.
[teacher] Ten rounds.  You know what, let's change it.  Instead of 49 and 99 hundredths, let's make it 99 and 99 hundredths.  Because what if you rolled a nine every time, then you'd be way over before you got to zero.  So before we start working with negative numbers, let's start with 99 and 99 hundredths.  That'll be better.
[student] I was about to ask you –",0,0,0
"[student] Yeah.
[teacher] Student J, I wanna see your work.  Remember, we don't ever just write answers.  You always need to show what you're thinking as a mathematician.  Student M and Student L, how we doing?

[teacher] So now we have to ask questions about our graph. I might as the class something about my graph. Questions, watch your hands. How many more slaves in Maryland than Alabama? How many stuff and go over there I can’t take that noise. And you making a fool of yourself on camera. Take your stuff, go on over there. When you get to three questions come on back and let me know okay? Thank you. I think it’s too much distraction. Take your book with you, you know why? Cause there are a lot of questions on this page that would be of assistance to you. You might say oh I’m gonna make my question like that, I’m just gonna make it about slaves. I need you to do two and three I said three questions.
[teacher] Sparkly shoes for the camera.  Okay, we are going to talk about calendar and then we are going to go over mountain math. Now, we were talking about the calendar shapes.  We have orange squares, blue rhombi, and red trapezoids.  Okay? And the question that I posed to you to think about was what do the numbers on those shapes have in common, okay? Let’s start with the orange squares.  I think those are the easiest ones.  I see a 1, a 4, a 9, and a 16.  Now, think about these numbers, let me isolate them on the board for you.  1, 4, 9, and 16.  And I think about types of numbers. These numbers all have something in common. Student W, get us started.","They are adding three and adding that plus four and then they are adding that, well times that by two and then adding one.","[teacher] Okay, anything else that anybody notices?  Student L?
[student] 1 is odd, 4 is even.  9 is odd, 16’s even.
[teacher] True, still not what I’m looking for.  Student M?
[student] Well, if you have one and then times it to three and then times it to three and then add one, you get four and then you skip one for times six.  And then you go to nine, which, never mind.",0,0,0
"[student] No.
[teacher] Okay, well when you are, we should recycle whatever you don’t need any more.  Okay, so I remember writing this with you last time.  So where is the beginning?
[student] Right here.
[teacher] And this comes –",We actually added two gestures because we forgot.,"[teacher] Okay, don’t do any more of that.  Where does that come?  Is that after this?

[student] And it goes…
[teacher] Okay, Student M.  I’m going to say “which means it stays the same,” just so that’s clear.
[student] I thought [inaudible].",0,0,0

[teacher] So this line from here to here, that is a half inch long. Well, it’s not drawn to scale.  That would be a half.  If I want sixteen-sixteenths, that should – have you gone to the nurse?  Now you join your group.  I’m sorry, what?

"[student] Number 4 if you do it on the three quarter inch, it won't fit.

[student] 3 and 4.
[teacher] Right.  So Student J, are we following instructions?  Step 1, 2, 3, and 4 are on the board.  So we're predicting, building, and checking.  And I noticed that you predicted for numbers 1 and 2.  Yesterday and today I explained that that's not what we're doing because you're gonna refine your prediction the second time around.  So what's your actual answer for this one?  Is it indeed 16?  So if it's your actual answer, should that be here?  Good.  So you should be showing that.  How we doing?",Good.  I'm just trying to find out how to do these.,"[teacher] How do draw the pattern?  Look back at numbers 1 and 2 and that may be helpful.  Right?  Ladies, are we all set?  I want you to show me your work for number 1.  Go ahead and try to complete your work for numbers 1 and 2 where the box and pattern are available.  So yesterday we were struggling a little bit with our initial predictions.  So I wanna review this today.  So if I'm looking at the number of cubes that are in that top photo, which looks like this, what do we know about how many cubes are in that top box?  What do you think?  How many cubes are in that top box?  You think there are 12.  Why do you think 12?
[student] [Inaudible].
[teacher] Why do you think 12?
[student] There's 3 here 'cause there's one on this side and 3 on the bottom.",0,0,0
"[student] Um-hum.
[teacher] Okay, so show me how you did that.  Do that.  So that’s a good strategy, you are putting the number, 1, 2, 3, in each one so that we know how many bags we have and you are putting the 4 above that, so know you know that you have your six bags, so your math was correct, it just was that you really didn’t represent it.  What you did was you did four bags with six in each and that’s not what it says.  So you would have avoided that if you would have underlined it and gone back so it’s important to use RUSK, okay, you see why we are doing that?  All right, so now you said 6 times 4 is 24.  Good.  And you always circle your answer. And reliable as well.  24 what?
[student] Oranges.
[teacher] So let’s put OR or something.  Okay, so that’s your first one. Now, let’s read a second question.  Can you read it out loud?","When Ms. S order oranges from the fruit company, they come in boxes.  Each box has 40 oranges inside it.  Last week, Ms. S ordered six boxes of oranges.  How may oranges did she order?","[teacher] Okay, so what is our next step then?  We read it.  Do we understand what they are asking?  Okay, so do we underline it?  Go back and underline.  40 oranges inside, okay, six boxes of oranges, how many oranges did she order.  So let’s get rid of this for now and we can stop thinking about that, but just look at this.  40 oranges inside.  We’ve got how many boxes?
[student] Six.
[teacher] Okay, so can we represent six boxes?  And how many oranges in each one?
[student] 40.",0,0,0

[teacher] From the tiles.","Yeah, from the 37, and then you get that number and then you roll the dice and then you get that number and there’s only –","[teacher] Why don’t you do the first one and then you can keep score that way.  You both need a marker though, Student C.  Okay, so you’re gonna take 37 divided by four.
[teacher] What will be next?  So it’s gonna end up with a remainder of one, so he gets one tile.  And you take that one away from 37, because now there’s only 36.  So your dividend is 36. Now you roll the dice and see what you divide it by – divisor.  So you’re gonna have 36 divided by four.

[teacher] Do you just want to talk to the group though just so that they can hear?
[student] So I know that’s not right because I have to get to 72.  So then I took 17 times 4 and that gave me 68.  So then I moved up just one to 18 times 4 and then that 8 times 4 is 32 and that's 7 so that gave me 72.  So it's 18.

"[student] That some people are going to quickly for him to really understand.
[teacher] That Student N, is really stuck and that he doesn’t understand and then it takes a really nice person like Student M, to be like hey, Student N, do you need help catching up or understanding this, but what you really don’t want is to be ending this challenge, oh Student G, I have a piece of paper for you and your group can tell you what to do.  You really don’t want to be ending this challenge with like three people in your group having all the answers and one person having no clue.  Okay?  So let’s just quickly go over the rules here. Rules, half-inch grid is for recording.  Everyone in your group must have it.  Now, let’s say Student C is just like, I’m not doing anything.  I’m having a bad day, my team didn’t win. I refuse to do it.   Obviously, you can’t change that and I’ll make exceptions if someone in your group is just being straight up impossible and I know that happens. That happened in the last class.  Okay, hold up the paper that’s for recording.  Wave it around kind of quietly.  Okay. One-inch grid is for experimenting, cutting, taping, you don’t have to make the cubes.  I’m not grading the actual cubes you create.  If you just fold it and see that it makes a cube don’t bother with the tape. The tape is for scissor and if you need to do surgery.  By that I mean, if you make a net that’s just a little off and you need to change something, do some surgery with the tape and the scissors, I’ll give you hints about that later. And lastly, flips, rotations do not count.  Let’s say, I keep losing my marker.  Let’s say you decided that net would make a cube, which it doesn’t.  So Student M is like ooh, ooh, guys, guys, I got another one.  And Student M draws this. Okay, Student M, what’s wrong with this one?  Oh, G, do you have an answer?
[student] Reflection.
[teacher] It’s a reflection, wonderful, so it won’t count.  Are there any last questions about this group challenge?   Yes.","So if you and your group like if pretend Student M had three-, counts wrong and he thinks he has 11, but he only has 10, what would happen then?","[teacher] That I’m understanding about.  What I’m concerned about is if who can I pick on now, if Student J is going, guys, I only have three can you help me and they are like, no Student J, we’re trying to finish this, shhhh be quiet.  And Student J is like, but guys, I want to get the next one and I want our group to win and they are like Student J, just follow along, I’m looking for that kind of stuff, okay?

And I tried to tell some of you who were using numbers to stay away from using numbers.  You could use it as an example at the end, but to describe a strategy that would help us find volume.  I want you to take a second to look at what you said yesterday in sequential order, what your steps were for finding the volume of our rectangular prism.

[teacher] Alright come over here so I can see what you do. 400, first let me finish doing what you hadn’t even started doing. You saw everybody write a name so you don’t even have to ask me what we had to do cause you did know that part. Finish writing the states down at the bottom like everybody in here has already done. I know you can do that, and write the title number of slaves in 1864.",I don’t know what you all was talking about.,"[teacher] And put the date on there. You fill in the date already he sure is. They told you it gonna be done every time. Let me see your first one South Carolina had 500 and you are correct good. So you check with—afterward I’m gonna show you with a coloring yes. Cause I want it to be colorful. But I wanna make sure it’s write first so I don’t blame you doing it in pencil first. So which one are you doing first? You?

We had Student I and C, you were going to show us what you said for the second problem.
[teacher] So everybody, when I say represent or show it, it’s important to draw it in pictures as well, because I noticed a couple of people were having difficulty understanding what to do, why would they have difficulty?  Why would some people maybe divide, why do you think you had a little problem with that, Student M, why do you think you did that instead of, where did you make your mistake?",I did division because I didn’t underline [Inaudible],"[teacher] Right, so underlining is helping, Student R, you to understand the question.

Today we’re finding the sum of the triangles, and we’re looking at these triangles, and we’re going to find the sum of the angles of these triangles.  Now who can tell me how, or if you can tell me how the angles of the triangle are related to a straight angle.  You have on your paper, your yellow sheet of paper, you have a straight angle.  You need to have an hour at both ends, because it’s a line on your paper.  You don’t have to draw that with that, just draw your arrow on the end, okay? Now what we’re fixing to do – and if you’ve got yours too small, it’s going to be very difficult to do what we’re fixing to do.  This is why Teacher A said do not make small ones, okay?  Now how are we going to show how the angles of a triangle are related to a straight angle.  Who can tell me some thinking?  What would be your thinking?","Because triangles – all the sides of a triangle have to be straight.  Well, that’s, that’s just logistics, yeah?  It has to be straight.

We also take that into consideration when we're actually looking at probability. You had a question, Student E?","Oh, with numerator and denominator, what if like – let's say you had like about 1,000 stars and you can't count them all, what's the ways that you have to put in the fraction?

And we will over that before we get to the end.  So if you have a larger number – Student E says what if you had a large number trying to think of the probability of something take place, you'll take a probability of a small sample set, and then make a proportion out of that.  But there is a way that you can do that.  Yes?
[student] Should I write all that down?
[teacher] Yes.  Just write down the fraction.  To write as a fraction, probability as a fraction, the numerator is the number of favorable outcomes.  The denominator would be the total number of outcomes.  We'll definitely need to use that 'cause you're going back the sheet, your note sheet please. The yellow note sheet.  There you go.

That’s their divisor.  So two – so you’re gonna have between the two of you – so this would be me, here’s you. Okay, so then you solve the problem, how many times does it go in, and that’s seven, that’s eight, that’s 16. So your remainder is one.  I get one tile.  You get the tiles by the remainders.  Then the remainder is subtracted from the tiles because now there’s only 36.  So you will have 36 as your divisor – dividend.  And then roll the dice and you’re gonna have to roll – so if this was my partner, they would take four into 36, which is nine, and there’s no remainder, so nobody gets it.  Stop.  So I have to go back and get 36.  Get another one.  I’m gonna divide 36 into six and I get six, so, oh, it’s still 36.  See how it’s working?
