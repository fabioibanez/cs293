"[student] Yes.
[teacher] All right.  Let’s give you a round of applause.  Excellent [inaudible].  [Applause].  Okay?  All right?  Why don’t you come on up.  Share yours.  You got one minute.
[student] [Inaudible].
[teacher] He’s going to show his tomorrow.  [Beeping].","This is my cover, and my table of contents.  My point line. Line segment.  [Inaudible].  My plane.  Acute angle.  My obtuse angle.  And right angle.  My quadrilaterals.  Three figures with symmetry.  And two figures without symmetry. The circles [inaudible] diameter, and radius, and circumference.  [Inaudible].  [Inaudible].","[teacher] All right.  Excellent.  Excellent.  If you’ll pass the microphone.  Okay.
[student] This is my table of contents.  This is my point line, line segment, ray and plane.  This is an acute angle, a right angle, and obtuse angle.  Square, rectangle, and rhombus. Parallelogram.  Trapezoid.  Symmetrical figures.  These are non-symmetrical figures.  This is the radius.  Diameter. Core.  Circumference.  This is a flip, slide, and turn. And this is my glossary.
[teacher] Excellent.  [Applause].
[student] This is my geometry [inaudible].  These are my [inaudible]. This is my quadrilateral.  My symmetry.  This is ones that like, can’t come together.  [Inaudible].  This is my circumference.  This is my rotation.  This is my [inaudible] and [inaudible].  And this is my glossary. [Applause].",0,0,0
"[student] Yes.  [Inaudible].
[teacher] Who's next?  Student A, do you have it?  Student G, do you have it?
[student] One hundred and twenty-five hundredths is less than thirty-five tenths.
[teacher] Say this again.",One hundred and twenty-five thousandths is less than thirty- five—,"[teacher] Hundredths.  Okay.  One hundred twenty-five thousandths, which is one eighth, is less than thirty-five hundredths.  Now when you look at this, you see 125, and you see 35, and automatically your mind things, well, I know 125 is greater than 35.  But it's not 125.  It's one hundred twenty-five thousandths is less than thirty-five thousandths, because remember, you have to start comparing the tenths place. The 1 is less than 3.  Now how did we get to this point? One eighth, guys, and seven twentieths – we cannot use common denominators here, can we?  But remember, I said you can use division.  1 divided by 8.  7 divided by 20.  Then of course you would have to use decimals.  Questions? Student S's team gets the point, and it looks like this team over here, Student E's team, you have more points, so I need you all to get ready to transition, and everybody on this team, come back and I'll get you a piece of candy. Let me dump this over here on the table.  You can choose one piece.
[teacher] Okay boys and girls, I’m gonna be using the overhead today.  I So I want you to look right now at the objectives up on the board for math.  Would someone please read the first objective right here with the bullet beside it?  Would someone read it for me please?  Student C?
[student] [Inaudible].
[teacher] It’s what?",0,0,0
"[student] You have to, if it say 8 you put it on the I think that’s the opposite side. The 6 go on the bottom and the middle.
[teacher] Opposite, why couldn’t—how do I know that this side is 6? Oh how do I know that this side is 6?
[student] Cause this one the 6 is on top.
[teacher] I do see a six on top but what else do I know about this thing Student J?",Because you put a long side and it’s a long side.,"[teacher] What is this thing Student A? No what is this thing Student D?
[student] [Inaudible].
[teacher] No sir it’s not. I know it’s not a square a square has four equal—so I would have to have a 6, 6, 6, 6, for it to be a square.
[multiple students] A square.",0,1,0
"[student] We didn't need [inaudible] minutes.
[teacher] Okay.  Let me hear from Student, sitting way back there in the back.  Student?
[student] Negative one.
[teacher] She says negative one is the answer.  Now, what mistake did Tanya make?  Because those are the answers I wanted.  We're analyzing this to see where this student went wrong and what the answer should be.  You found out what the answer should be.  There's another question.  How did you discover the answer?  So where'd she go wrong?  Where did she go wrong, Student?","She thought she could just add because the negative is higher. She thought she could just add the positive with the negative and equal another negative but – yeah, equal another positive but she couldn't, but she had to – how could I say it?","[teacher] Okay, you're off to a good start.  I'm gonna come back to you. Where'd she go wrong, Student?
[student] She went wrong because I think she didn't notice that the seven wasn't a negative, so she just added negative eight plus negative seven to get negative 15, but the seven is actually positive, so it should have been negative one.
[teacher] Okay, how many people agree with Student's explanation of where Tanya went wrong?
[student] [Inaudible]",0,1,0
"[student] Yeah.
[teacher] Okay.  Now, let’s go back.  We’ve got a group of square numbers, what other way could we classify the numbers, Student A?
[student] They are all prime.
[teacher] Okay, and tell me what a prime number is.",It only has a factor of one.,"[student] 2 is not prime.
[student] Yeah, it is.
[teacher] Okay, pick a number and factor it for me.  Pick one.
[student] [Inaudible] only had 1 and itself as a factor.",0,0,0
